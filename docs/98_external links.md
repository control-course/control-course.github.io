There are some great Control resources available elsewhere. All of these (c) their respective publishers.

    * Brian has created some [great and easily-accessible YouTube videos](https://engineeringmedia.com/videos), both on his own channel and for MathWorks.
    * He also created the [Map of Control Theory](https://engineeringmedia.com/maps) and a few MATLAB-specific ones that I refer to frequently in lectures.
    * And he's writing [a (partially-complete) textbook](https://engineeringmedia.com/books).

My students can also access recommended textbooks through the [resource list link on Bb](https://rl.talis.com/3/bristol/lists/D5D45C89-7492-BAC1-052E-79072BF85A8F.html) (or maybe here, does it work outside of Bb?).
