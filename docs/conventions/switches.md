# RC safety switch configuration

All Flight Lab flights should have the below switch configuration unless good reason to do otherwise. If any other configuration is used, clear briefing should be given to flight team (actually, clear briefing even if this configuration is used!).

* **flight mode** - top left (swA on Taranis), up (away from pilot/towards rear of controller) = most manual, further down = more automatic
* **RTL** - top second-left (swB on Taranis), down = initiate RTL
* **kill** - top right (swD on Taranis), down = kill motors and anything else
