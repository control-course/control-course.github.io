# MATLAB

This course currently uses MATLAB/Simulink, files are linked from relevant sections or can all be found in this [MATLAB Online folder](https://drive.mathworks.com/sharing/dd3ea9ef-52bd-4304-9625-a9ad75ae03b1).

I've considered Python/other alternatives but given [MATLAB Online](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html) has a free tier I'm focusing on that for now. Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to contribute other resources!
